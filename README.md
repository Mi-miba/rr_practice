# How to fold a paper airplane

1. Obtain a 8.5" x 11" piece of paper.
2. Fold the paper length wise. 
3. Open the paper and fold to corners that are on the short ends and fold them to the middle crease. Now there is a pointy end.
4. Now fold the corners again towards the crease, to have an even pointier end. 
5. Fold the paper again along the middle as in step 2. 
6. Fold each top edge down towards the bottom to make the wings. 
7. Fold out the wings so that it looks like an airplane. 
8. Toss the airplan. 

## Introduction
Here is some text to ***describe*** the overall goal of my data analysis plan.

## Results
* Describe the site that I obtained samples from
* Differences in richness between types of sites
* Differences in beta-diversity between types of sites

## Methods
### Experimental Design
We obtained 200 samples across various soils across BC. 

### DNA extraction and amplification
We used a DNA extraction kit. We amplified the genes.
